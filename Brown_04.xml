<Poem><Title>BALLAD OF BOOKER T.</Title>
by
<Author>Langston Hughes</Author>
<Title_Character type="only character">Booker T.</Title_Character>
Was a practical man.
He said, Till the soil
And learn from the land.
<Rhythm>Let down your bucket</Rhythm>
Where you are.
Your fate is here
And not afar.
To help yourself
And your fellow man,
<Rhythm type="phrase">Train your head,
Your heart, and your hand.</Rhythm>
For smartness alone's
Surely not meet—
If you haven't at the same time
Got something to eat.
Thus at Tuskegee
He built a school
With book-learning there
And the workman's tool.
He started out
In a simple way—
For yesterday
Was not today.
Sometimes he had
Compromise in his talk—
For a man must crawl
Before he can walk—
And in Alabama in '85
A joker was lucky
To be alive.
But Booker T.
Was nobody's fool:
You may carve a dream
With an humble tool.
The tallest tower
Can tumble down
If it be not rooted
In solid ground.
So, being a far-seeing
Education and Outreach Division
Practical man,
He said, <Rhythm type="repeated">Train your head,
Your heart, and your hand.</Rhythm>
<Phrase meaning="Destiny isn't set for you">Your fate is here
And not afar,
<Rhythm type="repeated">So let down your bucket</Rhythm>
Where you are.</Phrase>
</Poem>
